   <h2> the Greater Than Operator</h2>
<p> The greater than operator (>) compares the values of two 
    numbers. If the number to the left is greater than the
     number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, 
     it returns false.
    <br>
    Like the equality operator, the greater than operator 
    will convert data types of values while comparing. </p>
<p>
Examples

5   >  3  // true <br>
7   > '3' // true <br>
2   >  3  // false <br>
'1' >  9  // false <br>
</p>

    <h3>Greater Than Or Equal To Operator</h3>
<p>
    The greater than or equal to operator (>=) 
    compares the values of two numbers. 
    If the number to the left is greater than or 
    equal to the number to the right, it returns true. 
    Otherwise, it returns false

</p>

6   >=  6  // true <br>
7   >= '3' // true <br>
2   >=  3  // false <br>
'7' >=  9  // false <br>

    <h3> Less Than Or Equal To Operator</h3>
The less than or equal to operator <!-- <= -->compares the 
values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true. If the number on the left is greater than the number on the right, it returns false. Like the equality operator, the less than or equal to operator converts data types.

Examples
<!---


4  <= 5 // true br
'7' <= 7 // true
5   <= 5 // true
3   <= 2 // false
'8' <= 4 // false

<h3>Logical And Operator &&</h3>
    <p>
        the Logical And Operator
Sometimes you will need to test more than one thing at a time. The logical and operator (&&) returns true if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are true.

The same effect could be achieved by nesting an if statement inside another if:
<!--
if (num > 5) {
  if (num < 10) {
    return "Yes";
  }
}
return "No";
-->
    </p>

<h3> Introducing Else Statements</h3>
When a condition for an if statement is true,
 the block of code following it is executed. 
 What about when that condition is false? Normally
  nothing would happen. With an else statement, 
  an alternate block of code can be executed.

   <h3> Else If Statements</h3>
<p> If you have multiple conditions that need to be addressed,
     you can chain if statements together with 
     else if statements.</p>

    <h3>Logical Order in If Else Statement</h3>
    <p> Always maintain the logival order how the fucntion 
        is executed from top to bottom.
        Whivh statement that comes first
    </p>

  <h3>Chaining If Else Statements</h3>  
<p> if/else statements can be chained together 
    for complex logic. Here is pseudocode
     of multiple chained if / else if statements: </p>

     <p>
if (condition1) { <br>
  statement1 <br>
} else if (condition2) { <br>
  statement2 <br>
} else if (condition3) { <br>
  statement3 <br>
. . . <br>
} else { <br>
  statementN <br>
}

   <h3> Selecting from Many Options with Switch Statements </h3>
<h4> Problem Explanation </h4>
<p>A switch statement first evaluates its expression. 
    It then looks for the first case clause whose expression
     evaluates to the same value as the result of the input 
     expression (using the strict comparison 422, 
     (===) and transfers control to that clause, executing
      the associated statements. (If multiple cases match 
      the provided value, the first case that matches is 
      selected, even if the cases are not equal to each other.)
    </p> 
<p> If no matching case clause is found, the program looks 
    for the optional default clause, and if found, transfers 
    control to that clause, executing the associated statements. If no default clause is found, the program continues execution at the statement following the end of switch. By convention, the default clause is the last clause, but it does not need to be so.
</p>
<p> The optional break statement associated with each 
    case label ensures that the program breaks out of 
    switch once the matched statement is executed and 
    continues execution at the statement following switch. 
    If break is omitted, the program continues execution at
     the next statement in the switch statement.
    </p>

  <h3>  Multiple Identical Options in Switch Statements </h3> 
<p> If the break statement is omitted from a switch statement's case, the following case statement(s) are executed until a break is encountered. If you have multiple inputs with the same output, you can represent them in a switch statement like this:
<br>
let result = ""; <br>
switch (val) { <br>
  case 1: <br>
  case 2: <br>
  case 3: <br>
    result = "1, 2, or 3"; <br>
    break; <br>
  case 4: <br>
    result = "4 alone"; <br>
} <br>
<br>
Cases for 1, 2, and 3 will all produce the same result.

  <h3>  Replacing If Else Chains with Switch </h3>
<p> If you have many options to choose from, 
    a switch statement can be easier to write than
     many chained if/else if statements. The following:</p>

<div>
if (val === 1) { <br>
  answer = "a"; <br>
} else if (val === 2) { <br>
  answer = "b"; <br>
} else { <br>
  answer = "c"; <br>
} <br>
<br>
<p> can be replaced with: </p>

switch (val) { <br>
  case 1: <br>
    answer = "a"; <br>
    break; <br>
  case 2: <br>
    answer = "b"; <br>
    break; <br>
  default: <br>
    answer = "c"; <br>
} <br>
</div>

   <h3> Returning Boolean Values from Functions </h3>
<div>
   <p>In Comparison with the Equality Operator that 
    all comparison operators return a boolean 
    true or false value. </p>
    
   <p> Sometimes people use an if/else statement to do
     a comparison, like this: </p>
    
    <p>
    function isEqual(a, b) { <br>
      if (a === b) { <br>
        return true; <br>
      } else { <br>
        return false; <br>
      } <br>
    } <br>
    </p>

    <br>

   <p> But there's a better way to do this. 
    Since = = = returns true or false, we can return
     the result of the comparison: </p>
    <br>

    <h4>
    function isEqual(a, b) { <br>
      return a === b; <br>
    } <br>
    </h4>

  <h3> JavaScript Objects </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
    You may have heard the term object before.
    
    Objects are similar to arrays, except that
     instead of using indexes to access and modify 
     their data, you access the data in objects 
     through what are called properties. </p>
    
     <p>
    Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way,
     and can represent real world objects, like a cat.
    
    Here's a sample cat object:
        <br>
    const cat = { <br>
      "name": "Whiskers", <br>
      "legs": 4, <br>
      "tails": 1, <br>
      "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"] <br>
    }; <br>
    </p>
    </div>

    <br>
    <div>

  <p>
    In this example, all the properties are stored as strings,
     such as name, legs, and tails. However, you can also
      use numbers as properties. You can even omit the 
      quotes for single-word string properties, as </p>
    <br>
    const anotherObject = { <br>
      make: "Ford", <br>
      5: "five", <br>
      "model": "focus" <br>
    }; <br>
    <p>
    However, if your object has any non-string properties, 
    JavaScript will automatically typecast them as strings.
</p>
</div>

   <h3> Accessing Object Properties with Dot Notation </h3>

   <div>
   <p>
There are two ways to access the properties of an 
object: dot notation (.) and bracket notation ([]), 
similar to an array.

Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of 
the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

Here is a sample of using dot notation (.) to read an 
object's property: </p>

<br>
const myObj = { <br>
  prop1: "val1", <br>
  prop2: "val2" <br>
}; <br>
<br>
const prop1val = myObj.prop1; <br>
const prop2val = myObj.prop2; <br>
<p>prop1val would have a value of the string val1, 
    and prop2val would have a value of the string val2.</p> 


</div>
